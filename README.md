###  Calculate the CLV for each customer.
Customer segmentation was done using RFM analysis, this is a method commonly used in marketing and customer relationship management (CRM) to categorize customers based on their past behaviour. RFM stands for **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value,** which are three key dimensions used to evaluate customers.
The customers were categorised base on RFM analysis  to the following: **'Lost Customer', 'Evasive customer ',  'Almost lost customer ', 'High risk customer', 'Loosing Customer', 'Late belcomer','Potential customer', 'Recent Customer', 'Becoming Loyal ', 'Very Loyal' and 'Platinum Customer'.**
Based on RFM analysis, we have the most platinum customers and the fewest high-risk customers. However, it's crucial to focus on re-engaging the high-risk customers.
